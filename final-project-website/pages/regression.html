    <h1>Causes of injuries</h1>
    <p>
        This slide deals with causes of injuries, their effect on the number of people injured, and the importance to deal with them. <br /> Through multivariate regression analysis, we’ve obtained the effect of the different causes leading to traffic
        accidents in NYC. From the regression, we picked the coefficients on <i>the ten most common causes of accidents</i>, and used them to create the bar plot you see below. This might sound technical, but think about it this way: The ‘effect’ of each
        cause, is the estimated average number of people injured in an accident, if the given cause caused the accident. Thereby we have data on the ‘commonness’ of each cause and how serious they are when they happen. When you hover your cursor over
        the bars in the plot, you will see the exact number of accidents caused by each cause, and their estimated effect on the number of people injured. <br /> The number you see at the top of each bar, is the effect of the given cause, multiplied onto
        the total number of accidents caused by the cause. Thus we obtain an estimate of how important it is to deal with each cause. Another way to interpret the number is, that it is the estimated number of people injured by each cause.

        What’s important to note about several of these top ten causes of accidents is, that a lot of the causes have to do with the behaviour, inattention or mistake by the driver. Driver inattention is by far the most important cause of accidents to deal with.
        This data could be used in a public campaign to raise awareness of the importance of keeping your eyes on the road when you drive. <br /> Number five on the top ten accidents list is “Backing Unsafely”. This is a cause that could be reduced
        by technical devices, such as reversing cameras, that allows the driver better vision of what’s behind the vehicle.<br /> “Traffic Control Disregarded” is the top ten common cause, that has the highest effect on the number of people injured in
        an accident. This category contains accidents where the driver ignores a sign or signal. In these situations, other drivers can’t predict the behaviour of the driver, if he or she doesn’t follow the traffic laws. These types of accidents could
        be reduced by raising awareness by campaigns. Some of these situations might arise, because the signs or signals are lacking or difficult to interpret in the situations. Better signs thus might also add to the safety of the people using the roads
        and sidewalks of NYC.
