    <h1>Welcome to NYC Traffic Accidents!</h1>

    <p>
        Hi! Welcome to our website. This site deals with vehicle accidents causing injuries in New York City. Some three weeks ago, two men were injured critically after slamming their car into a tractor-trailer near Kennedy Airport in New York City (NYC). A
        little more than a week ago, three adults were injured and a young girl killed when a garbage truck hit another vehicle in a neighborhood in NYC (New York Times 2017). Back in March, a driver under the influence of alcohol killed a young college
        student on the Williamsburg Bridge. The examples are many, and points out how participation in the traffic of NYC is never without risk. Whether you are sitting in a car, taking your bike, or walking on the streets as a pedestrian, there is a
        chance you might be involved in a traffic accident. This is nothing new in NYC however. In 1913, E.S. Clowes, a statistician for the National Highways Protective City, quoted a captain in the American army for stating that he “felt safer on the
        bridge of a battleship in action than he did when trying to cross Broadway or Fifth Avenue” (Clowes 1913:449).

        Although one is always exposed to traffic injuries on the streets of NYC, there are some places and some hours of the day, days of the week, and months of the year in which traffic injuries are more likely to happen. This site is about exploring these
        patterns and showing their distribution. On this site, you can find information on the following questions. <br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                What are the most dangerous intersections in NYC when it comes to accidents causing injuries?
            </li>
            <li>
                Which moments of the day, the week, and the month are you most likely to see an injury?
            </li>
            <li>
                Which causes lead significantly to injuries?
            </li>
            <li>
                Is it possible to predict whether a vehicle accident causes an injury?
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Our aim with this site is to shed some lights on the what’s, when’s and why’s of injuries in New York City. Hopefully, this will create increased awareness of the need for a safer traffic environment in NYC, and, in the best of all worlds, prevent accidents
        such as the above presented from happening.

        <h3>The structure of the site</h3>
        <p>
            The site is structured along a series of pages. They contain the following: <br />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                On the page ‘Descriptive Statistics’, you can find information on when accidents causing at least one injury tend to happen more frequently, in which boroughs they tend to happen more often than others, and other interesting injury patterns.
            </li>
            <li>
                ‘Maps’ show the geographical distribution of injuries. Here you can find the top 25 intersections, which cause the most injuries. On this page, we also zoom in on the intersection with the highest amount of injuries per accident.
            </li>
            <li>
                ‘Causes of injuries’ show the result of a regression analysis on which factors contributes the most to an injury incident.
            </li>
            <li>
                On the page ‘Predicting injuries’, we attempt at developing a prediction model, which can tell whether an accident causes an injury or not.
            </li>
            <li>
                On the last page ‘Technicalities’, you can find background information on the statistics and programming behind this site. You can find links to the dataset and our explainers notebook, describing the calculations behind our findings.
            </li>
        </ul>
