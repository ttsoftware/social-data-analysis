        In the geomap below, the 25 places in NYC with the most accidents are plotted alongside the 25 places with most injuries. The yellow dots represent the places with most accidents in the city, and the orange dots represents the places with most injuries
        in the city. The red dots, are the places which are present on the top 25 list of accidents and the top 25 list of injuries. The dots are scaled after the number accidents which have taken place there, in the period of analysis. If you hover you
        cursor over the dots, on the map, you’ll see the address of each these places. The places are often intersections between two streets. Furthermore, when you hover, you’ll be presented with the number of accidents and injuries that has taken place
        in each place. It is evident from the visualization, that alot of the places that is on the top 25 list of most accidents are placed on Manhattan, whereas a lot of the places with most injuries are placed on Brooklyn. Why the distribution is exactly
        like this, could be interesting to analyzer further through qualitative case studies.
