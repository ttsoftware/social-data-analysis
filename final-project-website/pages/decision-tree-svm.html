    <h1>Predicting injuries</h1>

    <p>
        Given the large amount of historical data available to us, we would like to investigate whether or not accident responses can be improved by predicting whether or not an accident will involve an injury. If an injury is likely to occur at a given accident,
        the 911 response team or officers on scene might more quickly be able to decide whether or not an ambulance is needed.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to end up with the best prediction model, we are applying two different techniques for binary classification: Decision trees in the form of Random Forest Classification and Support Vector Machines. It is here our ambition to see which of the
        models does the best job of predicting whether an accident causes an injury or not. A warning: This page is quite technical.
    </p>

    <p>
        We made three datasets with different compositions in order to strengthen our testing and validation by trying to simulate out-of-sample validation.<br /> The first dataset is the "original" dataset of ~700,000 rows. This dataset is purged of
        rows with missing zip codes. We sampled from this dataset when training. <br /> The second dataset has a 50/50 ratio between accidents with injuries and accidents without injuries.<br /> In order to make this dataset, we sampled all the rows with
        1 or more injured and combined these row with an equal amount of randomly sampled datapoints from the original dataset. <br /> The third dataset contains only the rows from the original dataset with 1 or more injured.

    <h2>Decision Trees</h2>

    <p>
        Decision trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The idea behind decision trees is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the
        data features (Grus 2015:201f). Practically this means asking questions to data: Which borough did it happen in? Which zipcode? Which time of the day? We use our knowledge of already existing trends in the data to predict the outcome of the unseen
        data.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the table below, we see the results of our decision trees (with the use of random forest classification). The decision tree model is very good at fitting to the training data, but it has a hard time generalizing this. This may be a result of overfitting
        even though we are using random forest. We find a decent test accuracy on the full dataset, but as soon as we train on the balanced 50/50 dataset or the dataset with only injuries, the models performs quite poorly.

    <h2>Support Vector Machines</h2>

    <p>
        In order to classify whether or not a an accident would involve 1 or more injuried, we chose to use the commonly used supervised classifier Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification.
    </p>
    <p>
        We used the python library sklearn's builtin support vector classifier for performing the classification. <br /> We used three different settings for the support vector classifer: <br />

        <ul>
            <li>
                Setting 1: C=1, gamma=1/8, kernel=rbf
            </li>
            <li>
                Setting 2: C=1, gamma=0.001, kernel=rbf
            </li>
            <li>
                Setting 3: C=100, gamma=0.001, kernel=rbf
            </li>
        </ul>

        <small>C is the SVM error term.</small>
        <small>Gamma is the kernel coefficient which determines how sensitive SVM is to the distance from a data point to the decision boundary.</small>
        <small>Kernel is the kernel function used for non-linear classification. Rbf is the radial basis function kernel.</small>
    </p>
    <p>
        The tables below show the results after training on 80000 random samples and testing and validating on 10000 random samples. <br />

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        As seen in the tables above, we are not able to firmly predict whether or not an injury will occur using either decision tree or SVM classification. We do however find that the SVM classification did the best job of predicting the injuries. However, we
        do only observe around 50% accuracy on the 50/50 dataset for all three settings, which suggests that the model is no better than randomly guessing.
