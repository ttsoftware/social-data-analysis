<h1>Predicting injuries</h1>

<p>
    Given the large amount of historical data available to us,
    we would like to investigate whether or not accident responses can be improved by predicting whether or not an accident will involve an injury.
    If an injury is likely to occur at a given accident,
    the 911 response team or officers on scene might more quickly be able to decide whether or not an ambulance is needed.

<h2>Decision Trees</h2>

<h2>Support Vector Machines</h2>

<p>
    In order to classify whether or not a an accident would involve 1 or more injuried, we chose to use Support Vector Machines (SVM) since it is a commonly used supervised classifier for binary classification.
