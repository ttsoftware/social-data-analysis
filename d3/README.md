The main javascript files are located under src/ - the main file being main.js.
The javascript files are written in Ecmascript 6 and transpiled into Ecmascript 5 using Core-js and Babel. The file bundle.js contains the Babel output - all the code and dependencies for the website.
We are also using jQuery to enable the interactivity of the graphs.
